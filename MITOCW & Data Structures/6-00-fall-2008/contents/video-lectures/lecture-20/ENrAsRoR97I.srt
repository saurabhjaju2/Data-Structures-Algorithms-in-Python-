8
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:23,360
PROFESSOR: All right, so today
we're returning to

9
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:25,510
simulations.

10
00:00:25,510 --> 00:00:29,910
And I'm going to do at first, a
little bit more abstractly,

11
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:32,550
and then come back
to some details.

12
00:00:32,550 --> 00:00:38,310
So they're different ways to
classify simulation models.

13
00:00:38,310 --> 00:00:53,570
The first is whether it's
stochastic or deterministic.

14
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:57,400
And the difference here is in
a deterministic simulation,

15
00:00:57,400 --> 00:01:04,170
you should get the same result
every time you run it.

16
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:06,880
And there's a lot of uses we'll
see for deterministic

17
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,880
simulations.

18
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:14,030
And then there's stochastic
simulations, where the answer

19
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:17,720
will differ from run to run
because there's an element of

20
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:20,500
randomness in it.

21
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:23,030
So here if you run it again
and again you get the same

22
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:29,310
outcome every time,
here you may not.

23
00:01:29,310 --> 00:01:35,830
So, for example, the problem
set that's due today -- is

24
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:40,740
that a stochastic or
deterministic simulation?

25
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:42,940
Somebody?

26
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:45,740
Stochastic, exactly.

27
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:49,200
And that's what we're going
to focus on in this class,

28
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,990
because one of the interesting
questions we'll see about

29
00:01:51,990 --> 00:01:58,160
stochastic simulations is, how
often do have to run them

30
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,990
before you believe the answer?

31
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:03,940
And that turns out to be
a very important issue.

32
00:02:03,940 --> 00:02:05,960
You run it once, you get
an answer, you can't

33
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:07,740
take it to the bank.

34
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:09,850
Because the next time you run
it, you may get a completely

35
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:11,250
different answer.

36
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:15,250
So that will get us a little
bit into the whole issue of

37
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:19,130
statistical analysis.

38
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:31,180
Another interesting dichotomy
is static vs dynamic.

39
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:33,810
We'll look at both, but
will spend more

40
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:37,640
time on dynamic models.

41
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:43,340
So the issue -- it's
not my phone.

42
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:45,340
If it's your mother, you could
feel free to take it,

43
00:02:45,340 --> 00:02:48,150
otherwise --

44
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:50,600
OK, no problem.

45
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:54,090
Inevitable.

46
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:57,640
In a dynamic situation,
time plays a role.

47
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:00,900
And you look at how things
evolve over time.

48
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:07,950
In a static simulation, there
is no issue with time.

49
00:03:07,950 --> 00:03:11,700
We'll be looking at both, but
most of the time we'll be

50
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:15,990
focusing on dynamic ones.

51
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:20,060
So an example of this kind of
thing would be a queuing

52
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:24,930
network model.

53
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:27,630
This is one of the most popular
and important kinds of

54
00:03:27,630 --> 00:03:31,250
dynamic simulations.

55
00:03:31,250 --> 00:03:36,680
Where you try and look at how
queues, a fancy word for

56
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:40,580
lines, evolve over time.

57
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:44,320
So for example, people who are
trying to decide how many

58
00:03:44,320 --> 00:03:47,970
lanes should be in a highway,
or how far apart the exits

59
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:52,390
should be, or what should the
ratio of Fast Lane tolls to

60
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:54,650
manually staffed tolls
should be.

61
00:03:54,650 --> 00:04:00,240
All use queuing networks to try
and answer that question.

62
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,230
And we'll look at some examples
of these later

63
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:04,450
because they are
very important.

64
00:04:04,450 --> 00:04:06,080
Particularly for things
related to

65
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:10,440
scheduling and planning.

66
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:26,790
A third dichotomy is discrete
vs continuous.

67
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:32,590
Imagine, for example, trying to
analyze the flow of traffic

68
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:35,590
along the highway.

69
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:40,020
One way to do it, is to try and
have a simulation which

70
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:43,950
models each vehicle.

71
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:46,070
That would be a discrete
simulation, because you've got

72
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:47,800
different parts.

73
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:52,490
Alternatively, you might decide
to treat traffic as a

74
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:56,970
flow, kind of like water flowing
through things, where

75
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:59,410
changes in the flow can
be described by

76
00:04:59,410 --> 00:05:01,910
differential equations.

77
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:08,020
That would lead to a
continuous model.

78
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:13,560
Another example is, a lot of
effort has gone into analyzing

79
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:18,090
the way blood flows through
the human body.

80
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:22,250
You can try and model it
discretely, where you take

81
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:27,060
each red blood cell, each white
blood cell, and look at

82
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:30,770
how they move, or simulate
how they move.

83
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:33,280
Or you could treat it
continuously and say, well,

84
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,990
we're just going to treat blood
as a fluid, not made up

85
00:05:36,990 --> 00:05:41,190
of discrete components, and
write some equations to model

86
00:05:41,190 --> 00:05:45,630
how that fluid goes through
and then simulate that.

87
00:05:45,630 --> 00:05:51,300
In this course, we're going to
be focusing mostly on discrete

88
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:56,610
simulations.

89
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:59,230
Now if we think about the random
walk we looked at,

90
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:10,350
indeed it was stochastic,
dynamic, and discrete.

91
00:06:10,350 --> 00:06:15,770
The random walk was an example
of what's called a Monte Carlo

92
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:21,520
simulation.

93
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:28,240
This term was coined there.

94
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,450
Anyone know what that is?

95
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:34,170
Anyone want to guess?

96
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:39,530
It's the casino, in Monaco,
in Monte Carlo.

97
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:43,060
It was at one time, before there
was even a Las Vegas,

98
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:47,090
the most famous casino in
the world certainly.

99
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:50,060
Still one of the more opulent
ones as you can see.

100
00:06:50,060 --> 00:06:53,560
And unlike Las Vegas, it's real
opulence, as opposed to

101
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:57,090
faux opulence.

102
00:06:57,090 --> 00:07:01,680
And this term Monte Carlo
simulation, was coined by Ulam

103
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:07,010
and Metropolis, two
mathematicians, back in 1949,

104
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:10,050
in reference to the fact that at
Monte Carlos, people bet on

105
00:07:10,050 --> 00:07:15,480
roulette wheels, and cards on
a table, games of chance,

106
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:19,500
where there was randomness, and
things are discrete, in

107
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,120
some sense.

108
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:23,400
And they decided, well, this is
just like gambling, and so

109
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:28,370
they called them Monte
Carlos simulations.

110
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:33,820
What Is it that makes
this approach work?

111
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:40,430
And, in some sense, I won't go
into a lot of the math, but I

112
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:44,470
would like to get some
concepts across.

113
00:07:44,470 --> 00:07:47,130
This is an application of what
are called inferential

114
00:07:47,130 --> 00:07:50,960
statistics.

115
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:55,500
You have some sample size, some
number of points, and

116
00:07:55,500 --> 00:08:00,860
from that you try to infer
something more general.

117
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:06,230
We always depend upon one
property when we do this.

118
00:08:06,230 --> 00:08:18,990
And that property is that, a
randomly chosen sample tends

119
00:08:18,990 --> 00:08:44,360
to exhibit the same properties
as the population from which

120
00:08:44,360 --> 00:08:55,600
it is drawn.

121
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,360
So you take a population of
anything, red balls and black

122
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:06,020
balls, or students, or steps,
and at random draw some

123
00:09:06,020 --> 00:09:11,940
sample, and you assume that
that sample has properties

124
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:17,480
similar to the entire
population.

125
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:23,750
So if I were to go around this
room and choose some random

126
00:09:23,750 --> 00:09:32,220
sample of you guys and write
down your hair color, we would

127
00:09:32,220 --> 00:09:35,730
be assuming that the fraction
of you with blonde hair in

128
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:39,330
that sample would be the same
as the fraction of you with

129
00:09:39,330 --> 00:09:42,480
blonde hair in the
whole class.

130
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:44,510
That's kind of what
this means.

131
00:09:44,510 --> 00:09:50,550
And the same would be true of
black hair, auburn hair, etc.

132
00:09:50,550 --> 00:09:57,360
So consider, for example,
flipping a coin.

133
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:03,020
And if I were to flip it some
number of times, say 100

134
00:10:03,020 --> 00:10:09,780
times, you might be able to,
from the proportion of heads

135
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:13,380
and tails, be able to
infer whether or not

136
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:15,230
the coin was fair.

137
00:10:15,230 --> 00:10:17,700
That is to say, half the times
it would be heads, in half the

138
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:21,460
times it would be that tails, or
whether it was unfair, that

139
00:10:21,460 --> 00:10:24,450
it was somehow weighted, so that
heads would come up more

140
00:10:24,450 --> 00:10:26,160
than tails.

141
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:28,800
And you might say if we did this
100 times and looked at

142
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:33,660
the results, then we could make
a decision about what

143
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:37,130
would happen in general when
we looked at the coin.

144
00:10:37,130 --> 00:10:45,830
So let's look in an example
of doing that.

145
00:10:45,830 --> 00:10:48,880
So I wrote a little program,
it's on your

146
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:54,540
handout, to flip a coin.

147
00:10:54,540 --> 00:10:56,210
So this looks like
the simulations

148
00:10:56,210 --> 00:10:58,370
we looked at before.

149
00:10:58,370 --> 00:11:02,400
I've got flip trials, which says
that the number of heads

150
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:07,320
and tails is 0 for
i in x range.

151
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:09,690
What is x range?

152
00:11:09,690 --> 00:11:13,410
So normally you would have
written, for i in range zero

153
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:16,580
to num flips.

154
00:11:16,580 --> 00:11:21,570
What range does, is it creates a
list, in this case from 0 to

155
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:27,420
99 and goes through the
list of one at a time.

156
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:34,150
That's fine, but supposed num
flips were a billion.

157
00:11:34,150 --> 00:11:36,280
Well, range would create
a list with a

158
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:39,090
billion numbers in it.

159
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:42,190
Which would take a lot of
space in the computer.

160
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:44,980
And it's kind of wasted.

161
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:50,630
What x range says is, don't
bother creating the list just

162
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:54,440
go through the, in this case,
the numbers one at a time.

163
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:58,890
So it's much more efficient
than range.

164
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:03,260
It will behave the same way as
far as the answers you get,

165
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:06,480
but it doesn't use
as much space.

166
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,270
And since some of the
simulations we'll be doing

167
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:13,160
will have lots of trials, or
lots of flips, it's worth the

168
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,730
trouble to use x range
instead of range.

169
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:19,180
Yeah?

170
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:23,870
Pardon?

171
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:25,588
STUDENT: Like, why would
we ever use range

172
00:12:25,588 --> 00:12:26,210
instead of x range?

173
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:28,530
PROFESSOR: No good reason, when
dealing with numbers,

174
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:31,650
unless you wanted to do
something different with the

175
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:39,490
list. But, there's
no good reason.

176
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:40,900
The right answer for
the purposes of

177
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:43,040
today is, no good reason.

178
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,480
I typically use x range
all the time if I'm

179
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,980
thinking about it.

180
00:12:47,980 --> 00:12:51,700
It was just something that
didn't seem worth introducing

181
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,220
earlier in this semester.

182
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:55,210
But good question.

183
00:12:55,210 --> 00:13:03,010
Certainly deserving of
a piece of candy.

184
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:06,610
All right, so for i in x range,
coin is equal some

185
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:08,950
random integer 0 or 1.

186
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:13,910
If coin is equal to 0 then
heads, else tails.

187
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:16,010
Well, that's pretty easy.

188
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:19,620
And then all I'm going to do
here is go through and flip it

189
00:13:19,620 --> 00:13:23,720
a bunch of times, and
we'll get some

190
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:27,920
answer, and do some plots.

191
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:31,900
So let's look at an example.

192
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:55,480
We'll try -- we'll flip 100
coins, we'll do 100 trials and

193
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:59,660
see what we get.

194
00:13:59,660 --> 00:14:01,360
Error in multi-line statement.

195
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,020
All right, what have
I done wrong here?

196
00:14:05,020 --> 00:14:08,410
Obviously did something by
accident, edited something I

197
00:14:08,410 --> 00:14:12,920
did not intend edit.

198
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:15,190
Anyone spot what I did wrong?

199
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:18,410
Pardon?

200
00:14:18,410 --> 00:14:21,150
The parentheses.

201
00:14:21,150 --> 00:14:22,520
I typed where I didn't intend.

202
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,960
Which line?

203
00:14:24,960 --> 00:14:29,930
Down at the bottom?

204
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:35,940
Obviously my, here, yes,
I deleted that.

205
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:46,930
Thank you.

206
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:52,250
All right, so we have a couple
of figures here.

207
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:59,230
Figure one, I'm showing
a histogram.

208
00:14:59,230 --> 00:15:05,680
The number of trials on the
y-axis and the difference

209
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:08,130
between heads and tails , do
I have more of one than the

210
00:15:08,130 --> 00:15:10,920
other on the x-axis.

211
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:14,310
And so we what we could see
out of my 100 trials,

212
00:15:14,310 --> 00:15:20,140
somewhere around 22 of them
came out the same,

213
00:15:20,140 --> 00:15:21,410
close to the same.

214
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:25,900
But way over here we've
got some funny ones.

215
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:28,810
100 and there was a
difference of 25.

216
00:15:28,810 --> 00:15:31,070
Pretty big difference.

217
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:34,890
Another way to look at the same
data, and I'm doing this

218
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:37,180
just to show that there are
different ways of looking at

219
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:46,650
data, is here, what I've plotted
is each trial, the

220
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:49,900
percent difference.

221
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,400
So out of 100 flips.

222
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:54,830
And this is normalizing it,
because if I flip a million

223
00:15:54,830 --> 00:15:59,190
coins, I might expect the
difference to be pretty big in

224
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:01,420
absolute terms, but maybe
very small as a

225
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:04,790
percentage of a million.

226
00:16:04,790 --> 00:16:08,900
And so here, we can again see
that as these stochastic kinds

227
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:12,020
of things, there's a pretty
big difference, right?

228
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:17,680
We've got one where it was over
25 percent, and several

229
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:20,290
where it's zero.

230
00:16:20,290 --> 00:16:24,030
So the point here, we can see
from this graph, that if I'd

231
00:16:24,030 --> 00:16:28,260
done only one trial and just
assumed that was the answer as

232
00:16:28,260 --> 00:16:31,040
to whether my coin was weighted
or not, I could

233
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:35,100
really have fooled myself.

234
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:40,600
So the the main point is that
you need to be careful when

235
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:44,520
you're doing these
kinds of things.

236
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:48,310
And this green line
here is the mean.

237
00:16:48,310 --> 00:16:54,740
So it says on average, the
difference was seven precent.

238
00:16:54,740 --> 00:17:14,750
Well suppose, maybe, instead
of, flipping 100, I were to

239
00:17:14,750 --> 00:17:42,480
flip 1,000.

240
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,990
Well, doesn't seem to
want to notice it.

241
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:48,560
One more try and then I'll
just restart it, which is

242
00:17:48,560 --> 00:18:07,250
always the safest thing as
we've discussed before.

243
00:18:07,250 --> 00:18:14,760
Well, we won't panic.

244
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:20,830
Sometimes this helps.

245
00:18:20,830 --> 00:18:26,820
If not, here we go.

246
00:18:26,820 --> 00:18:29,890
So let's say we wanted
to flip 1,000 coins.

247
00:18:29,890 --> 00:18:33,880
So now what do we think?

248
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:36,920
Is the difference going to be
bigger or smaller than when we

249
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:37,620
flipped 100?

250
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:42,750
Is the average difference
between heads and tails bigger

251
00:18:42,750 --> 00:18:48,950
or smaller with 1,000 flips
than with 100 flips?

252
00:18:48,950 --> 00:18:51,930
Well, the percentage will be
smaller, but in absolute

253
00:18:51,930 --> 00:18:55,970
terms, it's probably going
to be bigger, right?

254
00:18:55,970 --> 00:19:01,750
Because I've got more
chances to stray.

255
00:19:01,750 --> 00:19:17,890
But we'll find out.

256
00:19:17,890 --> 00:19:22,930
So here we see that the mean
difference is somewhere in the

257
00:19:22,930 --> 00:19:25,670
twenties, which was much
higher than the mean

258
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:28,370
difference for 100 flips.

259
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:31,920
On the other hand, if we look at
the percentage, we see it's

260
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:32,560
much lower.

261
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:34,770
Instead of seven percent, it's
around two and a half percent

262
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:37,710
in the main.

263
00:19:37,710 --> 00:19:40,160
There's something else
interesting to observe in

264
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:44,860
figure two, relative to when we
looked at with 100 flips.

265
00:19:44,860 --> 00:19:46,500
What else is pretty interesting
about the

266
00:19:46,500 --> 00:19:49,620
difference between these two
figures, if you can remember

267
00:19:49,620 --> 00:19:52,460
the other one?

268
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:52,820
Yeah?

269
00:19:52,820 --> 00:19:54,500
STUDENT: There are no zeros?

270
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:57,850
PROFESSOR: There are no zeros.

271
00:19:57,850 --> 00:20:04,660
That's right, as it happens
there were no zeros.

272
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:07,290
Not so surprising that it
didn't ever come out

273
00:20:07,290 --> 00:20:10,560
exactly 500, 500.

274
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:14,420
What else?

275
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:16,810
What was the biggest difference,
percentage-wise,

276
00:20:16,810 --> 00:20:19,030
we saw last time?

277
00:20:19,030 --> 00:20:20,930
Over 25.

278
00:20:20,930 --> 00:20:24,940
So notice how much narrower
the range is here.

279
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:29,480
Instead of ranging from 2 to 25
or something like that, it

280
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:35,620
ranges from 0 to 7, or
maybe 7 and a little.

281
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:41,400
So, by flipping more coins, the
experiment becomes more

282
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,800
reproduce-able.

283
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:49,450
I'm looks like the same because
of scaling, but in

284
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:52,630
fact the range is
much narrower.

285
00:20:52,630 --> 00:20:57,200
Each experiment tends to give
an answer closer to all the

286
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:01,280
other experiments.

287
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,230
That's a good thing.

288
00:21:03,230 --> 00:21:08,300
It should give you confidence
that the answers are getting

289
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,900
pretty close to right.

290
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:13,810
That they're not bouncing
all over the place.

291
00:21:13,810 --> 00:21:17,360
And if I were to flip a million
coins, we would find

292
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:22,010
the range would get
very tight.

293
00:21:22,010 --> 00:21:24,810
So notice that even though
there's similar information in

294
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:30,380
the histogram and the plot,
different things leap out at

295
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:36,790
you, as you look at it.

296
00:21:36,790 --> 00:21:41,240
All right, we could ask a lot of
other interesting questions

297
00:21:41,240 --> 00:21:46,460
about coins here.

298
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:49,080
But, we'll come back to this in
a minute and look at some

299
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:52,030
other questions.

300
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:56,390
I want to talk again a little
bit more generally.

301
00:21:56,390 --> 00:21:59,370
It's kind of easy to think about
running a simulation to

302
00:21:59,370 --> 00:22:01,770
predict the future.

303
00:22:01,770 --> 00:22:06,730
So in some sense, we look at
this, and this predicts what

304
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:10,680
might happen if I flipped
1,000 coins.

305
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:16,620
That the most likely event
would be that I'd have

306
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:24,910
something under 10 in the
difference between heads and

307
00:22:24,910 --> 00:22:28,680
tails, but that it's not
terribly unlikely that I might

308
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:34,730
have close to 70 as
a difference.

309
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:38,090
And if I ran more than 100
trials I'd see more, but this

310
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:42,660
helps me predict what
might happen.

311
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:47,150
Now we don't always use
simulations to predict what

312
00:22:47,150 --> 00:22:47,960
might happen.

313
00:22:47,960 --> 00:22:52,690
We sometimes actually use
simulations to understand the

314
00:22:52,690 --> 00:22:54,540
current state of the world.

315
00:22:54,540 --> 00:22:59,460
So for example, if I told you
that we are going to flip

316
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:06,930
three coins, and I wanted you
to predict the probability

317
00:23:06,930 --> 00:23:09,960
that all three would be
either heads, or all

318
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,050
three would be tails.

319
00:23:12,050 --> 00:23:14,410
Well, if you'd studied any
probability, you could know

320
00:23:14,410 --> 00:23:15,990
how to do that.

321
00:23:15,990 --> 00:23:18,770
If you hadn't studied
probability, you would say,

322
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:22,210
well, that's OK, we have a
simulation right here.

323
00:23:22,210 --> 00:23:27,170
Let's just do it.

324
00:23:27,170 --> 00:23:45,360
Here we go again.

325
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,670
And so let's try it.

326
00:23:46,670 --> 00:24:06,160
Let's flip three coins, and
let's do it 4,000 times here.

327
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,630
Well, that's kind
of hard to read.

328
00:24:07,630 --> 00:24:09,720
It's pretty dense.

329
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:19,260
But we can see that the
mean here is 50.

330
00:24:19,260 --> 00:24:24,630
And, this is a little
easier to read.

331
00:24:24,630 --> 00:24:31,580
This tells us that, how many
times will the difference,

332
00:24:31,580 --> 00:24:38,200
right, be zero 3,000
out of 4,000.

333
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,920
Is that right?

334
00:24:39,920 --> 00:24:41,020
What do you think?

335
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:42,050
Do you believe this?

336
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:47,140
Have I done the right thing?
three coins, 4,000 flips, how

337
00:24:47,140 --> 00:24:49,280
often should they all be heads,
or how often should

338
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:54,000
they all be tails?

339
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:54,840
What does this tell us?

340
00:24:54,840 --> 00:25:01,150
It tells us one-fourth of the
time they'll all be-- the

341
00:25:01,150 --> 00:25:03,920
difference between, wait a
minute, how can the difference

342
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:09,610
between -- something's wrong
with my code, right?

343
00:25:09,610 --> 00:25:11,800
Because I only have two
possible values.

344
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:17,110
I hadn't expected this.

345
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:20,690
I obviously messed
something up.

346
00:25:20,690 --> 00:25:21,000
Pardon?

347
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,770
STUDENT: It's right.

348
00:25:22,770 --> 00:25:24,050
PROFESSOR: It's right,
because?

349
00:25:24,050 --> 00:25:28,992
STUDENT: Because you had an odd
number of flips, and when

350
00:25:28,992 --> 00:25:29,360
you split them --

351
00:25:29,360 --> 00:25:29,720
PROFESSOR: Pardon?

352
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:32,070
STUDENT: When you split
an odd number --

353
00:25:32,070 --> 00:25:35,070
PROFESSOR: Exactly.

354
00:25:35,070 --> 00:25:36,380
So it is correct.

355
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:37,860
And it gives us what we want.

356
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:41,150
But now, let's think about
a different situation.

357
00:25:41,150 --> 00:25:42,420
Anybody got a coin here?

358
00:25:42,420 --> 00:25:46,670
Anyone give me three coins?

359
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:55,100
I can trust somebody, I hope.

360
00:25:55,100 --> 00:25:57,160
What a cheap -- anybody got
silver dollars, would be

361
00:25:57,160 --> 00:25:59,420
preferable?

362
00:25:59,420 --> 00:26:01,470
All right, look at this.

363
00:26:01,470 --> 00:26:06,640
She's very carefully given
me three pennies.

364
00:26:06,640 --> 00:26:09,710
She had big, big money in that
purse, too, but she didn't

365
00:26:09,710 --> 00:26:11,120
want me to have it.

366
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:15,140
All right, so I'm going to
take these three pennies,

367
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:19,440
jiggle them up, and now ask you,
what's the probability

368
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:24,290
that all three of
them are heads?

369
00:26:24,290 --> 00:26:26,770
Anyone want to tell me?

370
00:26:26,770 --> 00:26:30,180
It's either 0 or 1, right?

371
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:32,050
And I can actually look
at you and tell you

372
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:33,890
exactly which it is.

373
00:26:33,890 --> 00:26:38,420
And you can't see which it is.

374
00:26:38,420 --> 00:26:43,070
So, how should you think about
what the probability it?

375
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:48,960
Well, you might as well assume
that it's whatever this graph

376
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,810
tells you it is.

377
00:26:52,810 --> 00:26:55,730
Because the fact that you
don't have access to the

378
00:26:55,730 --> 00:26:59,570
information, means that you
really might as well treat the

379
00:26:59,570 --> 00:27:02,250
present as if it's the future.

380
00:27:02,250 --> 00:27:04,400
That it's unknown.

381
00:27:04,400 --> 00:27:08,950
And so in fact we frequently,
when there's data out there

382
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:13,420
that we don't have access to,
we use simulations and

383
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:17,570
probabilities to estimate, make
our best guess, about the

384
00:27:17,570 --> 00:27:20,690
current state of the world.

385
00:27:20,690 --> 00:27:24,670
And so, in fact, guessing the
value of the current state, is

386
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:27,900
really no different from
predicting the value of a

387
00:27:27,900 --> 00:27:34,230
future state when you don't
have the information.

388
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:40,530
In general, all right, now,
just to show that your

389
00:27:40,530 --> 00:27:52,860
precautions were unnecessary.

390
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:55,170
Where was I?

391
00:27:55,170 --> 00:27:57,660
Right.

392
00:27:57,660 --> 00:28:05,470
In general, when we're trying
to predict the future, or in

393
00:28:05,470 --> 00:28:09,850
this case, guess the present, we
have to use information we

394
00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:17,100
already have to make our
prediction or our best guess.

395
00:28:17,100 --> 00:28:21,590
So to do that, we have to always
ask the question, is

396
00:28:21,590 --> 00:28:28,860
past behavior a good prediction
of future behavior?

397
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:32,095
So if I flip a coin 1,000 times
and count up the heads

398
00:28:32,095 --> 00:28:35,230
and tails, is that a good
prediction what will happen

399
00:28:35,230 --> 00:28:39,720
the next time?

400
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:44,010
This is a step people often
omit, in doing these

401
00:28:44,010 --> 00:28:46,360
predictions.

402
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:49,430
See the recent meltdown of
the financial system.

403
00:28:49,430 --> 00:28:52,910
Where people had lots of
stochastic simulations

404
00:28:52,910 --> 00:28:55,040
predicting what the market would
do, and they were all

405
00:28:55,040 --> 00:28:58,640
wrong, because they were all
based upon assuming samples

406
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:02,660
drawn from the past would
predict the future.

407
00:29:02,660 --> 00:29:06,270
So, as we build these models,
that's the question you always

408
00:29:06,270 --> 00:29:08,840
have to ask yourself.

409
00:29:08,840 --> 00:29:14,770
Is, in some sense, this true?

410
00:29:14,770 --> 00:29:17,810
Because usually what we're doing
is, we're choosing a

411
00:29:17,810 --> 00:29:21,130
random sample from the
past and hoping it

412
00:29:21,130 --> 00:29:24,960
predicts the future.

413
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:27,700
And that is to say, is the
population we have available

414
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:31,620
the same has the one
in the future.

415
00:29:31,620 --> 00:29:34,620
So it's easy to see how one
might use these kinds of

416
00:29:34,620 --> 00:29:39,570
simulations to figure out things
that are inherently

417
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:41,150
stochastic.

418
00:29:41,150 --> 00:29:47,300
So for example, to predict
a poker hand.

419
00:29:47,300 --> 00:29:49,830
What's the probability of my
getting a full house when I

420
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:53,060
draw this card from the deck?

421
00:29:53,060 --> 00:29:55,770
To predict the probability of
coming up with a particular

422
00:29:55,770 --> 00:29:57,530
kind of poker hand.

423
00:29:57,530 --> 00:30:02,080
Is a full house more probable
than a straight?

424
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:03,300
Or not?

425
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:06,600
Well, you can deal out lots of
cards, and count them up, just

426
00:30:06,600 --> 00:30:12,360
as Ulam suggested
for Solitaire.

427
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,690
And that's often what we do.

428
00:30:14,690 --> 00:30:18,720
Interestingly enough though,
we can use randomized

429
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:25,430
techniques to get solutions
to problems that are not

430
00:30:25,430 --> 00:30:29,000
inherently stochastic.

431
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:31,000
And that's what I
want to do now.

432
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:37,770
So, consider for example, pi.

433
00:30:37,770 --> 00:30:41,900
Many of you have probably
heard of this.

434
00:30:41,900 --> 00:30:45,140
For thousands of years,
literally, people have known

435
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:51,390
that there is a constant, pi,
associated with circles such

436
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:59,820
that pi times the radius squared
equals the area.

437
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:03,160
And they've known that pi times
the diameter is equal to

438
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:08,740
the circumference.

439
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:13,120
So, back in the days of the
Egyptian pharaohs, it was

440
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:15,870
known that such a constant
existed.

441
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:17,910
In fact, it didn't acquire
the name pi

442
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:20,260
until the 18th century.

443
00:31:20,260 --> 00:31:22,500
And so they called it
other things, but

444
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:26,660
they knew it existed.

445
00:31:26,660 --> 00:31:30,130
And for thousands of years,
people have speculated on what

446
00:31:30,130 --> 00:31:32,460
it's value was.

447
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:42,530
Sometime around 1650 BC, the
Egyptians said that pi was

448
00:31:42,530 --> 00:31:46,850
3.16, something called
the Rhind Papyrus,

449
00:31:46,850 --> 00:31:52,230
something they found.

450
00:31:52,230 --> 00:31:56,620
Many years later, about
1,000 years later, the

451
00:31:56,620 --> 00:32:04,540
Bible said pi was three.

452
00:32:04,540 --> 00:32:11,450
And I quote, this is describing
the specifications

453
00:32:11,450 --> 00:32:15,170
for the Great Temple of Solomon.
"He made a molten sea

454
00:32:15,170 --> 00:32:19,720
of 10 cubits from brim to brim,
round in compass, and 5

455
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:23,800
cubit the height thereof, and
a line of 30 cubits did

456
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:29,780
compass it round about." So, all
right, so what we've got

457
00:32:29,780 --> 00:32:32,070
here is, we've got everything
we need to plug into these

458
00:32:32,070 --> 00:32:37,070
equations and solve for pi,
and it comes out three.

459
00:32:37,070 --> 00:32:42,300
And it does this in more than
one place in the Bible.

460
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:46,440
I will not comment on the
theological implications of

461
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:49,960
this assertion.

462
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:52,030
Sarah Palin might.

463
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:55,330
And Mike Huckabee
certainly would.

464
00:32:55,330 --> 00:33:00,790
The first theoretical
calculation of pi was carried

465
00:33:00,790 --> 00:33:05,820
out by Archimedes, a great
Greek mathematician from

466
00:33:05,820 --> 00:33:11,150
Syracuse, that was about
somewhere around 250 BC.

467
00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:19,040
And he said that pi was
somewhere between 223 divided

468
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:31,190
by 71, and 22 divided by 7.

469
00:33:31,190 --> 00:33:34,550
This was amazingly profound.

470
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:39,340
He knew he didn't know what the
answer was, but he had a

471
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:42,030
way to give an upper and a lower
bound, and say it was

472
00:33:42,030 --> 00:33:45,190
somewhere between these
two values.

473
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:50,630
And in fact if you calculate it,
the average of those two

474
00:33:50,630 --> 00:33:56,210
values is 3.1418.

475
00:33:56,210 --> 00:33:58,830
Not bad for the time.

476
00:33:58,830 --> 00:34:00,880
This was not by measurement,
he actually had a very

477
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:04,750
interesting way of
calculating it.

478
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:09,260
All right, so this is where it
stood, for years and years,

479
00:34:09,260 --> 00:34:12,200
because of course people forgot
the Rhind Papyrus, and

480
00:34:12,200 --> 00:34:15,250
they forgot Archimedes, and they
believed the Bible, and

481
00:34:15,250 --> 00:34:19,040
so three was used
for a long time.

482
00:34:19,040 --> 00:34:23,710
People sort of knew it wasn't
right, but still.

483
00:34:23,710 --> 00:34:33,170
Then quite interestingly, Buffon
and Laplace, two great

484
00:34:33,170 --> 00:34:36,580
French mathematicians, actually
people had better

485
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:39,690
estimates using Archimedes'
methods long before they came

486
00:34:39,690 --> 00:34:45,780
along, proposed a way to do
it using a simulation.

487
00:34:45,780 --> 00:34:52,580
Now, since Laplace lived between
1749 and 1827, it was

488
00:34:52,580 --> 00:34:56,240
not a computer simulation.

489
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:59,010
So I'm going to show you,
basically, the way that he

490
00:34:59,010 --> 00:35:08,150
proposed to do it. the basic
idea was you take a square,

491
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:12,410
assume that's a square, and you
inscribe in it a quarter

492
00:35:12,410 --> 00:35:16,060
of a circle.

493
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:23,870
So here, you have the radius
of the square r.

494
00:35:23,870 --> 00:35:31,490
And then you get some person to,
he used needles, but I'm

495
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:37,130
going to use darts, to throw
darts at the shape.

496
00:35:37,130 --> 00:35:44,520
And some number of the darts
will land in the circle part,

497
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:48,960
and some number of the darts
will land out here, in the

498
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:55,610
part of the square that's not
inscribed by the circle.

499
00:35:55,610 --> 00:36:02,260
And then we can look at the
ratio of the darts in the

500
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:10,560
shaded area divided by
the total number of

501
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:16,900
darts in the square.

502
00:36:16,900 --> 00:36:27,220
And that's equal to the shaded
area divided by the area of

503
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:31,070
the square.

504
00:36:31,070 --> 00:36:34,800
The notion being, if they're
landing at random in these

505
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:41,460
places, the proportion here and
not here will depend upon

506
00:36:41,460 --> 00:36:44,540
the relative areas.

507
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:45,870
And that certainly
makes sense.

508
00:36:45,870 --> 00:36:49,780
If this were half the area of
the square, then you'd expect

509
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:55,130
half the darts to
land in here.

510
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:58,970
And then as you can see in your
handout, a little simple

511
00:36:58,970 --> 00:37:09,000
algebra can take this, plus pi r
squared equals the area, you

512
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:16,180
can solve for pi, and you can
get that pi is equal to 4, and

513
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:20,210
I'll write it, h, where h is
the hit ratio, the number

514
00:37:20,210 --> 00:37:22,810
falling in here.

515
00:37:22,810 --> 00:37:27,330
So people sort of see why that
should work intuitively?

516
00:37:27,330 --> 00:37:31,660
And that it's a very clever idea
to use randomness to find

517
00:37:31,660 --> 00:37:34,090
a value that there's nothing
random about.

518
00:37:34,090 --> 00:37:36,570
So we can now do
the experiment.

519
00:37:36,570 --> 00:37:42,330
I need volunteers
to throw darts.

520
00:37:42,330 --> 00:37:44,100
Come on.

521
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:48,500
Come on up.

522
00:37:48,500 --> 00:37:50,360
I need more volunteers.

523
00:37:50,360 --> 00:37:51,360
I have a lot of darts.

524
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:56,230
Anybody else?

525
00:37:56,230 --> 00:37:58,130
Anybody?

526
00:37:58,130 --> 00:38:00,270
All right, then since you're
all in the front

527
00:38:00,270 --> 00:38:07,330
row, you get stuck.

528
00:38:07,330 --> 00:38:11,180
So now we'll try it.

529
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:14,780
And you guys, we'll see how many
of you hit in the circle,

530
00:38:14,780 --> 00:38:20,910
and how many of you hit there.

531
00:38:20,910 --> 00:38:24,160
Go ahead, on the count of
3, everybody throw.

532
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:28,350
1, 2, 3.

533
00:38:28,350 --> 00:38:30,880
Ohh!

534
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:34,220
He did that on purpose.

535
00:38:34,220 --> 00:38:36,450
You'll notice Professor Grimson
isn't here today, and

536
00:38:36,450 --> 00:38:38,240
that's because I told him he was
going to have to hold the

537
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:41,240
dart board.

538
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:47,680
Well, what we see here is, we
ignore the ones that missed

539
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:49,890
all together.

540
00:38:49,890 --> 00:38:52,590
And we'll see that, truly,
I'm assuming

541
00:38:52,590 --> 00:38:54,180
these are random throws.

542
00:38:54,180 --> 00:38:55,570
We have one here and two here.

543
00:38:55,570 --> 00:39:01,430
Well, your eyes will tell you
that's the wrong ratio.

544
00:39:01,430 --> 00:39:04,660
Which suggests that having
students throw darts is not

545
00:39:04,660 --> 00:39:07,390
the best way to solve
this problem.

546
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:09,770
And so you will see in your
handout a computer

547
00:39:09,770 --> 00:39:14,250
simulation of it.

548
00:39:14,250 --> 00:39:20,300
So let's look at that.

549
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:23,520
So this is find pi.

550
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:26,380
So at the beginning of this
code, by the way, it's not on

551
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:29,540
your handout, is some magic.

552
00:39:29,540 --> 00:39:32,530
I got tired of looking at big
numbers without commas

553
00:39:32,530 --> 00:39:34,910
separating the thousands
places.

554
00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:36,440
You've see me in other
lectures counting

555
00:39:36,440 --> 00:39:38,920
the number of zeros.

556
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:43,630
What we have here is, that just
tells it I have to have

557
00:39:43,630 --> 00:39:47,050
two versions, one for the
Mac, and one for the PC.

558
00:39:47,050 --> 00:39:51,070
To set some variables that had
to write integers, things in

559
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:54,380
general, and I'm saying here, do
it the way you would do it

560
00:39:54,380 --> 00:39:57,940
in the United States
in English.

561
00:39:57,940 --> 00:40:00,530
And UTF8 is just an extended
character code.

562
00:40:00,530 --> 00:40:02,350
Anyway, you don't need to learn
anything about this

563
00:40:02,350 --> 00:40:05,930
magic, but it's just a handy
little way to make the numbers

564
00:40:05,930 --> 00:40:09,290
easier to read.

565
00:40:09,290 --> 00:40:14,940
All right, so let's let's
try and look at it.

566
00:40:14,940 --> 00:40:18,740
There's not much interesting
to see here.

567
00:40:18,740 --> 00:40:21,680
I've done this little thing,
format ints, that uses this

568
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:25,910
magic to say grouping equals
true, that means put a comma

569
00:40:25,910 --> 00:40:27,990
in the thousand places.

570
00:40:27,990 --> 00:40:29,470
But again, you can
ignore all that.

571
00:40:29,470 --> 00:40:37,860
The interesting part, is that
from Pylab I import star,

572
00:40:37,860 --> 00:40:39,640
import random in math.

573
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:42,730
As some of you observed, the
order these imports matters.

574
00:40:42,730 --> 00:40:45,970
I think I sent out an email
yesterday explaining what was

575
00:40:45,970 --> 00:40:47,510
going on here.

576
00:40:47,510 --> 00:40:49,880
This was one of the things
that I knew, and probably

577
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,120
should've mentioned.

578
00:40:51,120 --> 00:40:54,250
But since I knew it, I thought
everyone knew.

579
00:40:54,250 --> 00:40:55,230
Silly me.

580
00:40:55,230 --> 00:40:58,760
It was of course a dumb
thing to think.

581
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:00,940
And then I'm going to throw
a bunch of darts.

582
00:41:00,940 --> 00:41:03,140
The other thing you'll notice
is, throw darts has a

583
00:41:03,140 --> 00:41:05,910
parameter called should plot.

584
00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:09,370
And that's because when I
throw a billion darts, I

585
00:41:09,370 --> 00:41:11,530
really don't want to try and
take the time to plot a

586
00:41:11,530 --> 00:41:13,420
billion points.

587
00:41:13,420 --> 00:41:18,030
So let's first look at
a little example.

588
00:41:18,030 --> 00:41:32,090
We'll try throwing
10,000 darts.

589
00:41:32,090 --> 00:41:38,640
And it gives me an estimated
value of pi of 3.16.

590
00:41:38,640 --> 00:41:44,370
And what we'll see here, is
that the number of darts

591
00:41:44,370 --> 00:41:46,660
thrown, the estimate
changes, right?

592
00:41:46,660 --> 00:41:52,780
When I threw one dart, the
estimate of pi was 4.

593
00:41:52,780 --> 00:41:56,780
I threw my second dart, it
dropped all the way to 3.

594
00:41:56,780 --> 00:41:59,450
And then it bounced around a
while, and then at the end, it

595
00:41:59,450 --> 00:42:03,420
starts to really stabilize
around the true value.

596
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:06,680
You'll notice, by the way, that
what I've got here is a

597
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:08,420
logarithmic x-axis.

598
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:11,620
If you look at the code, you'll
see I've told it to be

599
00:42:11,620 --> 00:42:13,710
semi log x.

600
00:42:13,710 --> 00:42:16,440
And that's because I wanted you
to be able to see what was

601
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:19,460
happening early on, where
it was fluctuating.

602
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:21,490
But out here it's kind of
boring, because the

603
00:42:21,490 --> 00:42:23,970
fluctuations are so small.

604
00:42:23,970 --> 00:42:34,100
So that was a good
way to do it.

605
00:42:34,100 --> 00:42:37,020
All right now.

606
00:42:37,020 --> 00:42:38,940
Do I think I have enough
samples here?

607
00:42:38,940 --> 00:42:43,290
Well, I don't want you to cheat
and look at the estimate

608
00:42:43,290 --> 00:42:45,070
and say no, you don't, because
you know that's

609
00:42:45,070 --> 00:42:46,740
not the right answer.

610
00:42:46,740 --> 00:42:51,670
And, it's not even as good
as Archimedes did.

611
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:55,360
But how could you sort of look
at the data, and get a sense

612
00:42:55,360 --> 00:42:58,580
that maybe this is not
the right answer?

613
00:42:58,580 --> 00:43:01,720
Well, even at the end, if we
look at it, it's still

614
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:03,390
wiggling around a fair amount.

615
00:43:03,390 --> 00:43:12,050
We can zoom in.

616
00:43:12,050 --> 00:43:14,220
And it's bouncing up
and down here.

617
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:20,350
I'm in a region, but it's sort
of makes us think that maybe

618
00:43:20,350 --> 00:43:22,100
it hasn't stabilized, right?

619
00:43:22,100 --> 00:43:27,150
You'd like it to not be
moving very much.

620
00:43:27,150 --> 00:43:31,080
Now, by the way, the other thing
we could've looked at,

621
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:38,490
when we ran it, let's run
it again, probably get a

622
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:43,700
different answer by the way.

623
00:43:43,700 --> 00:43:47,160
Yeah, notice the different
answer here.

624
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:49,020
Turns out to be a better answer,
but it's just an

625
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:55,760
accident, right?

626
00:43:55,760 --> 00:43:59,270
Notice in the beginning it
fluctuates wildly, and it

627
00:43:59,270 --> 00:44:01,810
fluctuates less wildly
at the end.

628
00:44:01,810 --> 00:44:04,850
Why is that?

629
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:06,545
And don't just say because
it's close to right

630
00:44:06,545 --> 00:44:09,210
and it knows it.

631
00:44:09,210 --> 00:44:13,180
Why do the mathematics of this,
in some sense, tell us

632
00:44:13,180 --> 00:44:16,450
it has to fluctuate less
wildly at the end?

633
00:44:16,450 --> 00:44:17,200
Yes?

634
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:22,950
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

635
00:44:22,950 --> 00:44:27,100
PROFESSOR: Exactly,
exactly right.

636
00:44:27,100 --> 00:44:30,130
If I've only thrown two darts,
the third dart can have a big

637
00:44:30,130 --> 00:44:33,110
difference in the
average value.

638
00:44:33,110 --> 00:44:35,710
But if I've thrown a million
darts, the million and first

639
00:44:35,710 --> 00:44:38,530
can't matter very much.

640
00:44:38,530 --> 00:44:41,510
And what this tells me is, as
I want ever more digits of

641
00:44:41,510 --> 00:44:47,570
precision, I have to run a lot
more trials to get there.

642
00:44:47,570 --> 00:44:50,960
And that's often true, that
simulations can get you in the

643
00:44:50,960 --> 00:44:55,180
neighborhood quickly, but the
more precision you want, the

644
00:44:55,180 --> 00:45:00,920
number of steps grows
quite quickly.

645
00:45:00,920 --> 00:45:03,570
Now, the fact that I got such
different answers the two

646
00:45:03,570 --> 00:45:08,000
times I ran this suggests
strongly that I shouldn't

647
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,310
believe either answer.

648
00:45:10,310 --> 00:45:13,300
Right?

649
00:45:13,300 --> 00:45:17,300
So we need to do
something else.

650
00:45:17,300 --> 00:45:30,890
So let's try something else.

651
00:45:30,890 --> 00:45:32,760
Let's try throwing a lot
more darts here,

652
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:42,420
and see what we get.

653
00:45:42,420 --> 00:45:44,780
Now if you look at my code,
you'll see I'm printing

654
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:47,950
intermediate values.

655
00:45:47,950 --> 00:45:50,700
Every million darts, I'm
printing the value.

656
00:45:50,700 --> 00:45:53,890
And I did that because the first
time I ran this on a big

657
00:45:53,890 --> 00:45:56,920
number, I was afraid I had an
infinite loop and my program

658
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:58,570
was not working.

659
00:45:58,570 --> 00:46:01,040
So I just said, all right, let's
put a print statement in

660
00:46:01,040 --> 00:46:06,560
the loop, so I could see that
it's making progress.

661
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:08,910
And then I decided it was just
kind of nice to look at it, to

662
00:46:08,910 --> 00:46:11,390
see what was going on here.

663
00:46:11,390 --> 00:46:15,970
So now you see that if I throw
10 million darts, I'm starting

664
00:46:15,970 --> 00:46:18,500
to get a much better estimate.

665
00:46:18,500 --> 00:46:22,580
You'll also see, as predicted,
that as I get further out, the

666
00:46:22,580 --> 00:46:26,300
value of the estimate changes
less and less with each

667
00:46:26,300 --> 00:46:29,590
million new darts, because it's
a smaller fraction of the

668
00:46:29,590 --> 00:46:31,570
total darts.

669
00:46:31,570 --> 00:46:36,000
But it's getting a lot better.

670
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:40,650
Still not quite there.

671
00:46:40,650 --> 00:46:47,190
Let's just see what happens,
I can throw in another one.

672
00:46:47,190 --> 00:46:51,230
This is going to take
a little while.

673
00:46:51,230 --> 00:46:53,930
So I can talk while
it's running.

674
00:46:53,930 --> 00:47:06,790
Oops, what did I do here?

675
00:47:06,790 --> 00:47:12,520
So, it's going to keep on going
and going and going.

676
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:15,520
And then if we were to run it
with this number of darts

677
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:18,950
several times over, we would
discover that we got answers

678
00:47:18,950 --> 00:47:22,040
that were very, very similar.

679
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:27,010
From that we can take comfort,
statistically, that we're

680
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:30,880
really getting close to the
same answer every time, so

681
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:34,810
we've probably thrown enough
darts to feel comfortable that

682
00:47:34,810 --> 00:47:39,580
we're doing what's statistically
the right thing.

683
00:47:39,580 --> 00:47:41,650
And that there maybe isn't
a lot of point in

684
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:43,750
throwing more darts.

685
00:47:43,750 --> 00:47:48,120
Does that mean that we have
the right answer?

686
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:51,690
No, not necessarily, and that's
what we're going to

687
00:47:51,690 --> 00:47:53,750
look at next week.

688
00:47:53,750 --> 00:47:54,342
