8
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:24,460
PROFESSOR: I want to pick
up exactly where I

9
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:26,260
left off last time.

10
00:00:26,260 --> 00:00:29,080
When I was talking about various
sins one can commit

11
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:31,140
with statistics.

12
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:45,400
And I had been talking about the
sin of data enhancement,

13
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:49,280
where the basic idea there is,
you take a piece of data, and

14
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:51,820
you read much more into
it than it implies.

15
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:56,810
In particular, a very common
thing people do with data is

16
00:00:56,810 --> 00:01:01,900
they extrapolate.

17
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:08,080
I'd given you a couple
of examples.

18
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:17,270
In the real world, it's often
not desirable to say that I

19
00:01:17,270 --> 00:01:21,770
have a point here, and a point
here, therefore the next point

20
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:23,840
will surely be here.

21
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,400
And we can just extrapolate
in a straight line.

22
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:30,560
We before saw some examples
where I had an algorithm to

23
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,410
generate points, and we fit a
curve to it, used the curve to

24
00:01:34,410 --> 00:01:36,190
predict future points,
and discovered

25
00:01:36,190 --> 00:01:40,720
it was nowhere close.

26
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,650
Unfortunately, we often see
people do this sort of thing.

27
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:49,950
One of my favorite stories is,
William Ruckelshaus, who was

28
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:52,140
head of the Environmental
Protection Agency

29
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,740
in the early 1970s.

30
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:58,840
And he had a press conference,
spoke about the increased use

31
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:03,360
of cars, and the decreased
amount of carpooling.

32
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,970
He was trying to get people to
carpool, since at the time

33
00:02:05,970 --> 00:02:10,980
carpooling was on the way down,
and I now quote, "each

34
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:15,760
car entering the central city,
sorry, in 1960," he said,

35
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,630
"each car entering the central
city had 1.7 people in it.

36
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:25,540
By 1970. this had dropped
to less than 1.2.

37
00:02:25,540 --> 00:02:30,660
If present trends continue, by
1980, more than 1 out of every

38
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:36,890
10 cars entering the city will
have no driver." Amazingly

39
00:02:36,890 --> 00:02:40,990
enough, the press reported this
as a straight story, and

40
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:45,130
talked about how we would be
dramatically dropping.

41
00:02:45,130 --> 00:02:49,640
Of course, as it happened,
it didn't occur.

42
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:53,470
But it's just an example of, how
much trouble you can get

43
00:02:53,470 --> 00:02:56,880
into by extrapolating.

44
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:00,870
The final sin I want to talk
about is probably the most

45
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:13,830
common, and it's called the
Texas sharpshooter fallacy.

46
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:15,626
Now before I get into
that, are any of

47
00:03:15,626 --> 00:03:17,390
you here from Texas?

48
00:03:17,390 --> 00:03:19,670
All right, you're going
to be offended.

49
00:03:19,670 --> 00:03:23,870
Let me think, OK, anybody
here from Oklahoma?

50
00:03:23,870 --> 00:03:24,380
You'll like it.

51
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:26,610
I'll dump on Oklahoma, it will
be much better then.

52
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:32,530
We'll talk about the Oklahoma
sharpshooter fallacy.

53
00:03:32,530 --> 00:03:37,780
We won't talk about the
BCS rankings, though.

54
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:40,800
So the idea here is a
pretty simple one.

55
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:45,020
This is a famous marksman who
fires his gun randomly at the

56
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:52,470
side of a barn, has a bunch of
holes in it, then goes and

57
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:59,480
takes a can of paint and draws
bullseyes around all the

58
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:02,550
places his bullets
happened to hit.

59
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:07,770
And people walk by the barn
and say, God, he is good.

60
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:13,750
So obviously, not a good thing,
but amazingly easy to

61
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:16,400
fall into this trap.

62
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:17,790
So here's another example.

63
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:24,840
In August of 2001, a paper which
people took seriously

64
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,950
appeared in a moderately serious
journal called The New

65
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:33,050
Scientist. And it announced that
researchers in Scotland

66
00:04:33,050 --> 00:04:37,850
had proven that anorexics
are likely to have

67
00:04:37,850 --> 00:04:41,830
been born in June.

68
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:44,080
I'm sure you all knew that.

69
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,750
How did how did they
prove this?

70
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:47,570
Or demonstrate this?

71
00:04:47,570 --> 00:04:59,950
They studied 446 women.

72
00:04:59,950 --> 00:05:04,790
Each of whom had been
diagnosed anorexic.

73
00:05:04,790 --> 00:05:21,520
And they observed that about 30
percent more than average

74
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:33,620
were born in June.

75
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:36,950
Now, since the monthly average
of births, if you divide this

76
00:05:36,950 --> 00:05:43,200
by 12, it's about 37, that
tells us that 48

77
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:47,210
were born in June.

78
00:05:47,210 --> 00:05:50,360
So at first sight, this seems
significant, and in fact if

79
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:55,370
you run tests, and ask what's
the likelihood of that many

80
00:05:55,370 --> 00:05:58,270
more being born in 1
month, you'll find

81
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:04,780
that it's quite unlikely.

82
00:06:04,780 --> 00:06:08,680
In fact, you'll find the
probability of this happening

83
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:16,210
is only about 3 percent, of it
happening just by accident.

84
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:19,180
What's wrong with
the logic here?

85
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:19,670
Yes?

86
00:06:19,670 --> 00:06:24,010
STUDENT: They only studied
diagnosed anorexics.

87
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:26,210
PROFESSOR: No, because they were
only interested in the

88
00:06:26,210 --> 00:06:30,700
question of when are anorexics
born, so it made sense to only

89
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:31,390
study those.

90
00:06:31,390 --> 00:06:34,630
Now maybe you're right, that we
could study that, in fact,

91
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:37,860
more people are born
in June period.

92
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:38,740
That could be true.

93
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:40,100
This would be one of
the fallacies we

94
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:42,220
looked at before, right?

95
00:06:42,220 --> 00:06:44,990
That there's a lurking variable
which is just that

96
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:47,550
people are more likely
to be born in June.

97
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:50,610
So that's certainly
a possibility.

98
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:52,320
What else?

99
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:53,370
What else is the flaw?

100
00:06:53,370 --> 00:07:04,610
Where's the flaw
in this logic?

101
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:06,680
Well, what did they do?

102
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:12,380
They participated in the
Oklahoma sharpshooter fallacy.

103
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:17,960
What they did is, they looked
at 12 months, they took the

104
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:23,190
months with the most births in
it, which happened to be June,

105
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:29,460
and calculated the probability
of 3 percent.

106
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:34,130
They didn't start with the
hypothesis that it was June.

107
00:07:34,130 --> 00:07:36,770
They started with 12 months, and
then they drew a bullseye

108
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:39,890
around June.

109
00:07:39,890 --> 00:07:43,560
So the right question to ask
is, what's the probability,

110
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:49,930
not that June had 48 babies, but
that at least one of the

111
00:07:49,930 --> 00:07:55,090
12 months had 48 babies.

112
00:07:55,090 --> 00:08:04,570
That probability is a lot to
higher than 3 percent, right?

113
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:10,540
In fact, it's about
30 percent.

114
00:08:10,540 --> 00:08:17,750
So what we see is, again
perfectly reasonable

115
00:08:17,750 --> 00:08:21,440
statistical techniques, but
not looking at things

116
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,810
in the right way.

117
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:26,760
And answering the
wrong question.

118
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:29,100
That make sense to everybody?

119
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:31,990
And you can see why people can
fall into this trap, right?

120
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:36,820
It was a perfectly sensible,
seemingly sensible argument.

121
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:41,560
So the moral of this particular
thing is, be very

122
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:48,840
careful about looking at your
data, drawing a conclusion,

123
00:08:48,840 --> 00:08:53,330
and then saying how probable
was that to have occurred?

124
00:08:53,330 --> 00:08:56,120
Because again, you're probably,
or maybe, drawing

125
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:59,790
the bullseye around something
that's already there.

126
00:08:59,790 --> 00:09:05,840
Now if they had taken another
set of 446 anorexics, and

127
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:09,390
again June was the month,
then there would be some

128
00:09:09,390 --> 00:09:11,320
credibility in it.

129
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,560
Because they would have started
with the hypothesis,

130
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:17,700
not that there existed a month,
but that June was

131
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:19,480
particularly likely.

132
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:22,300
But then they would have to also
check and make sure that

133
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:25,690
June isn't just a popular
month to be born, as was

134
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,500
suggested earlier.

135
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:30,560
All right, I could go on and
on with this sort of thing,

136
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,990
it's kind of fun.

137
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:34,210
But I won't.

138
00:09:34,210 --> 00:09:36,900
Instead I'm going to torture
you with yet one more

139
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:39,310
simulation.

140
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:43,420
You may be tempted at this
point to just zone out.

141
00:09:43,420 --> 00:09:45,100
Try not to.

142
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:48,460
And as an added incentive for
you to pay attention, I'm

143
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:52,300
going to warn you that this
particular simulation will

144
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:58,080
appear in the final,
or a variant of it.

145
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:02,160
And what we'll be doing is,
early next week we'll be

146
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,790
distributing code, which we'll
ask you to study, about two or

147
00:10:06,790 --> 00:10:11,580
three pages of code, and then
on the final we'll be asking

148
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:13,570
you questions about the code.

149
00:10:13,570 --> 00:10:15,140
Not that you have to memorize
it, we'll give

150
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:16,690
you a copy of it.

151
00:10:16,690 --> 00:10:20,140
But you should understand
it before you walk

152
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,750
in to take the final.

153
00:10:21,750 --> 00:10:24,130
Because there will not be time
to look at that code for the

154
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:26,720
first time during the
quiz, and figure

155
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,130
out what it's doing.

156
00:10:30,130 --> 00:10:38,640
OK, so let's look at it.

157
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:41,930
I should also warn you that this
code includes some Python

158
00:10:41,930 --> 00:10:46,100
concepts, at least one, that
you have not yet seen.

159
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,370
We'll see it briefly today.

160
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:51,950
This is on purpose, because one
of the things I hope you

161
00:10:51,950 --> 00:10:55,520
have learned to do this
semester, is look up things

162
00:10:55,520 --> 00:10:57,760
you don't know, and figure
out what they do.

163
00:10:57,760 --> 00:10:59,810
What they mean.

164
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:03,830
Because we obviously can't, in
any course, or even any set of

165
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:05,270
courses, tell you everything
you'll ever

166
00:11:05,270 --> 00:11:07,150
want to know in life.

167
00:11:07,150 --> 00:11:10,290
So intentionally, we've seeded
some things in this program

168
00:11:10,290 --> 00:11:13,190
that will be unfamiliar, so
during the time you're

169
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:16,440
studying the program, get
online, look it up, figure out

170
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,150
what they do.

171
00:11:18,150 --> 00:11:21,580
If you have trouble, we will be
having office hours, where

172
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:23,920
you can go and get some help.

173
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,720
But the TAs will expect you to
have at least tried to figure

174
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:27,620
it out yourself.

175
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:27,980
Yeah?

176
00:11:27,980 --> 00:11:30,420
STUDENT: Will the final
be open note?

177
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:33,450
PROFESSOR: Final will be open
book, open notes, just like

178
00:11:33,450 --> 00:11:34,570
the quizzes.

179
00:11:34,570 --> 00:11:37,680
It will be the first two hours
of the allotted time, we won't

180
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:44,400
go the whole 3 hours, OK?

181
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:48,300
So it won't be hugely longer
than the quizzes.

182
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:49,700
It would be a little
bit longer.

183
00:11:49,700 --> 00:11:56,250
And again, very much in the
same style of the quizzes.

184
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:59,350
All right, let's look at this.

185
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:03,990
Let's assume that you've won the
lottery, and have serious

186
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:09,570
money that you foolishly wish to
invest in the stock market.

187
00:12:09,570 --> 00:12:15,890
There are two basic strategies
to choose from, in investing.

188
00:12:15,890 --> 00:12:27,450
You can either have what's
called an indexed portfolio,

189
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:41,510
or a managed portfolio.

190
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:45,300
Indexed portfolios, you
basically say, I want to own

191
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:49,430
all of the stocks that there
are, and if the stock market

192
00:12:49,430 --> 00:12:51,630
goes up, I make money, if
the stock market goes

193
00:12:51,630 --> 00:12:53,160
down, I lose money.

194
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:55,760
I'm not going to be thinking
I'm clever, and can pick

195
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:57,350
winners and losers, I'm
just betting on

196
00:12:57,350 --> 00:13:00,000
the market as a whole.

197
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:03,570
They're attractive, in
that a, they don't

198
00:13:03,570 --> 00:13:05,660
require a lot of thought.

199
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:09,270
And b, they have what's called
a low expense ratio, since

200
00:13:09,270 --> 00:13:11,660
they're easy to implement, you
don't pay anyone to be

201
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:13,670
brilliant to implement
if for you.

202
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:17,100
So they're very low fees.

203
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:21,090
A managed portfolio, you find
somebody you think is really

204
00:13:21,090 --> 00:13:26,680
smart, and you pay them a fair
amount of money, and in return

205
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:30,420
they assert that they will pick
winners for you, and in

206
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:33,420
fact, you will outperform
the stock market.

207
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:36,600
And if it goes up 6 percent,
well you'll go up 10 percent

208
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:40,460
or more, and if it goes down,
don't worry, I'm so smart your

209
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:45,200
stocks won't go down.

210
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:47,520
There's a lot of debate
about which is the

211
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:52,800
better of these two.

212
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:55,570
And so now we're going to try
and see if we can write a

213
00:13:55,570 --> 00:14:01,190
simulation that will give us
some insight as to which of

214
00:14:01,190 --> 00:14:06,010
these might be better
or worse.

215
00:14:06,010 --> 00:14:10,780
All right, so that's
the basic problem.

216
00:14:10,780 --> 00:14:16,110
Now, as we know, and by the way
we're not going to write a

217
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:18,600
perfect simulation here, because
we're going to try and

218
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:21,070
do it in 40 minutes,
or 30 minutes.

219
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:24,590
And it would take at least an
hour do a perfect simulation

220
00:14:24,590 --> 00:14:26,140
of the stock market.

221
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:29,090
All right.

222
00:14:29,090 --> 00:14:33,190
First thing we need to do is
have some sort of a theory.

223
00:14:33,190 --> 00:14:36,730
When we did the spring, we had
this theory of Hooke's Law

224
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:40,010
that told us something, and we
built a simulation, or built

225
00:14:40,010 --> 00:14:42,830
some tools around that theory.

226
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:47,460
Now we need to think about a
model of the stock market.

227
00:14:47,460 --> 00:14:53,190
And the model we're going to use
is based on what's called

228
00:14:53,190 --> 00:15:00,840
the Efficient Market
Hypothesis.

229
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:05,070
So the moral here, again, is
whenever you're doing an

230
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:07,490
implementation of a simulation,
you do need to

231
00:15:07,490 --> 00:15:12,210
have some underlying theory
about the model.

232
00:15:12,210 --> 00:15:14,900
What this model asserts
is that markets are

233
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:31,130
informationally efficient.

234
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:36,280
That is to say, current prices
reflect all publicly known

235
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:43,510
information about each stock,
and therefore are unbiased.

236
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:46,860
That if people thought that
the stock was underpriced,

237
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:49,170
well people would buy more of
it in the price would have

238
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:51,070
risen already.

239
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:53,570
If people thought the stock was
overpriced, well, people

240
00:15:53,570 --> 00:15:56,810
would have tried to sell it, and
it would have come down.

241
00:15:56,810 --> 00:16:01,420
So this is a very popular
theory, believed by many

242
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:06,880
famous economists today, and
in the past. And says, OK,

243
00:16:06,880 --> 00:16:13,700
that effectively means that
the market is memoryless.

244
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:16,330
OK, that it doesn't matter what
the price of the stock

245
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:18,610
was yesterday.

246
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:23,100
Today, it's priced given the
best-known information, and so

247
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:29,900
tomorrow it's equally likely
to go up or down.

248
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:32,640
Relative to the whole
market, right?

249
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:36,640
It's well known that over
periods of multiple decades,

250
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:39,090
the market has a tendency
to go up.

251
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:42,620
And so there's an upward bias to
the stock market, contrary

252
00:16:42,620 --> 00:16:46,150
to what you may have
seen recently.

253
00:16:46,150 --> 00:16:49,480
But that no particular stock
is more or less likely to

254
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:53,610
outperform the market, because
all the information is

255
00:16:53,610 --> 00:16:56,690
incorporated in the price.

256
00:16:56,690 --> 00:17:01,100
And that leads to a notion of
being able to model the

257
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:04,800
market, how?

258
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:09,010
How would you model individual
stocks if you believe this

259
00:17:09,010 --> 00:17:14,350
hypothesis?

260
00:17:14,350 --> 00:17:15,520
Somebody?

261
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,340
What's going to happen?

262
00:17:16,340 --> 00:17:18,640
STUDENT: Random walk.

263
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:20,910
PROFESSOR: Yes, exactly right.

264
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:23,260
So we would model it
as a random walk.

265
00:17:23,260 --> 00:17:26,110
In fact, there's a very famous
book called A Random Walk Down

266
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:30,240
Wall Street, that was one of
the first to make this

267
00:17:30,240 --> 00:17:34,040
hypothesis.

268
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:38,730
Now later, we may decide to
abandon this model, but for

269
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:43,010
the moment let's accept that.

270
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:46,500
And let's think about how
we're going to build the

271
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:53,810
simulation.

272
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:58,190
Whenever I think about how to
build an interesting program,

273
00:17:58,190 --> 00:18:01,070
and I hope whenever you think
about it, the first thing I

274
00:18:01,070 --> 00:18:05,720
think about is, what are the
classes I might want to have,

275
00:18:05,720 --> 00:18:08,680
what are the types?

276
00:18:08,680 --> 00:18:12,130
And it seems pretty obvious
that at least two of the

277
00:18:12,130 --> 00:18:18,070
things I'm going to want
are stock and market.

278
00:18:18,070 --> 00:18:22,770
After all, I'm going to try and
build a simulation of the

279
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:26,170
stock market, so I might as
well have the notion of a

280
00:18:26,170 --> 00:18:31,330
market, and probably the
notion of a stock.

281
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:35,880
Which should I implement
first?

282
00:18:35,880 --> 00:18:40,200
Well, my usual style of
programming would be to

283
00:18:40,200 --> 00:18:45,260
implement the one that's lowest
down in the hierarchy,

284
00:18:45,260 --> 00:18:48,370
near the bottom.

285
00:18:48,370 --> 00:18:50,810
I won't be able to show you what
a market does unless I

286
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:55,430
have stocks, but I can look at
what an individual stock does

287
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:58,120
without having a market.

288
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:00,620
So why do I implement
this first?

289
00:19:00,620 --> 00:19:06,080
Because it will be easier to
unit test. I can build class

290
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:10,780
stock, and I can test class
stock, before I

291
00:19:10,780 --> 00:19:16,080
have a class market.

292
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:30,740
So now let's look at it.

293
00:19:30,740 --> 00:19:38,510
Clean up the desktop
a little bit.

294
00:19:38,510 --> 00:19:42,490
This is similar to, but not
identical to, what you have in

295
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:48,390
your handout.

296
00:19:48,390 --> 00:19:53,150
All right, so there's
class stock.

297
00:19:53,150 --> 00:19:58,350
And I'm going to initialize
it, create them, with an

298
00:19:58,350 --> 00:19:59,710
opening price.

299
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:02,400
When a stock is first listed in
the market, it comes with

300
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:06,040
some price.

301
00:20:06,040 --> 00:20:10,550
I'm gonna keep as part of each
stock, it's history of prices,

302
00:20:10,550 --> 00:20:13,860
which we can initialize, well,
I've initialized it as empty,

303
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:17,210
but that's probably the
wrong thing, right?

304
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:26,500
I probably should have had it
being the, starting here,

305
00:20:26,500 --> 00:20:32,040
right, the opening price.

306
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,650
Now comes an interesting part.

307
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:38,620
Self dot distribution.

308
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:46,990
Well, I lied to you a little bit
in my description of what

309
00:20:46,990 --> 00:20:53,760
it meant to have the Efficient
Market Hypothesis.

310
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:59,670
I said that no stock is likely
to outperform the market or

311
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:02,480
underperform the market.

312
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:06,980
But it's not quite true, because
typically what they

313
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:21,120
actually do that, is they say
it's adjusted for risk.

314
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:27,240
It's clear that some stocks are
more volatile than others.

315
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:31,830
If you will buy stock in an
electrical utility which has a

316
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:34,940
guaranteed revenue stream,
because no matter how bad the

317
00:21:34,940 --> 00:21:39,790
economy gets, a lot of people
still use electricity, you

318
00:21:39,790 --> 00:21:43,450
don't expect it to
fluctuate a lot.

319
00:21:43,450 --> 00:21:49,850
If you buy stock in a high
tech company, that sells

320
00:21:49,850 --> 00:21:53,580
things on the internet, you
might expect it to fluctuate

321
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:55,160
enormously.

322
00:21:55,160 --> 00:21:59,570
Or if you buy stock in a
retailer, you might expect it

323
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:04,530
to go up or down more
dramatically with the economy,

324
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:09,470
and so in fact there is a notion
of risk, and I'm not

325
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:12,370
going to do this in this
simulation, but usually people

326
00:22:12,370 --> 00:22:15,240
have to be paid to take risk.

327
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:18,660
And so it's usually the case
that you can get a higher

328
00:22:18,660 --> 00:22:20,870
return if you're willing
to take more risk.

329
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:27,420
We might or might not have time
to come back to that.

330
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:32,980
But more generally, the point
is, that each stock actually

331
00:22:32,980 --> 00:22:36,150
behaves a little bit
differently.

332
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:39,350
There's a distribution
of how it would move.

333
00:22:39,350 --> 00:22:45,040
So even if, on average, the
stock is expected to not move

334
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:50,840
at all from where it starts,
some stocks will be expected

335
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:53,500
to just trundle along
without much

336
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:56,630
change, not very volatile.

337
00:22:56,630 --> 00:23:02,550
And other stocks might jump up
and down a lot because they're

338
00:23:02,550 --> 00:23:03,370
very volatile.

339
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:07,240
Even if the expected value
is the same, they'd

340
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:10,300
move around a lot.

341
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:12,500
So how can we model this
kind of thing?

342
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:16,930
Well, we've already looked
at the basic notion.

343
00:23:16,930 --> 00:23:19,850
Last time we looked at the
notion, last lecture we looked

344
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:25,640
at the idea of a distribution.

345
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:29,610
And when we do a simulation,
we're pulling the samples from

346
00:23:29,610 --> 00:23:33,330
some distribution.

347
00:23:33,330 --> 00:23:37,340
It could be normal, everything,
that would be a

348
00:23:37,340 --> 00:23:41,530
Gaussian, where if you recall
there was a mean, and a

349
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:47,510
standard deviation, and most
values were going to be close

350
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:49,480
to the mean.

351
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:52,170
Especially if there is a small
standard deviation.

352
00:23:52,170 --> 00:23:56,340
If there's a large standard
deviation it would be spread.

353
00:23:56,340 --> 00:23:58,680
Or it could be uniform,
where every

354
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,190
value was equally probable.

355
00:24:00,190 --> 00:24:03,560
We also looked at exponential.

356
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:08,300
So we're going to assign to each
stock, when we create it,

357
00:24:08,300 --> 00:24:11,230
a distribution.

358
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:17,330
Some way of visualizing, or
thinking about, where we draw

359
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:20,370
the price changes from.

360
00:24:20,370 --> 00:24:26,880
This gets us into a new
linguistic concept, which

361
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,790
we'll see down here.

362
00:24:29,790 --> 00:24:33,310
You don't have this particular
code on your handout, you do

363
00:24:33,310 --> 00:24:36,340
have a code that uses
the same concept.

364
00:24:36,340 --> 00:24:39,430
So here's my unit
test procedure.

365
00:24:39,430 --> 00:24:42,240
And here's where I'm going
to create distributions.

366
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:45,460
And I'm going to look at two.

367
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:49,930
A random-- a uniform,
and a Gaussian.

368
00:24:49,930 --> 00:24:56,810
What lambda that does, it
creates on the fly a function,

369
00:24:56,810 --> 00:24:59,370
as the program runs.

370
00:24:59,370 --> 00:25:03,440
That I can then pass around.

371
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:08,520
So here, I'm going to look at
the thing random dot uniform,

372
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:11,880
for example, between minus
volatility and plus

373
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,270
volatility.

374
00:25:13,270 --> 00:25:16,710
So ignoring the lambda, what
do we expect random dot

375
00:25:16,710 --> 00:25:19,340
uniform to do?

376
00:25:19,340 --> 00:25:26,020
It has equally likely, in the
range from minus volatility to

377
00:25:26,020 --> 00:25:35,470
plus volatility, it will return
any value in here.

378
00:25:35,470 --> 00:25:39,640
But notice the previous line,
where I am computing

379
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:42,620
volatility.

380
00:25:42,620 --> 00:25:47,680
If I wanted every stock to have
the same volatility, I

381
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:50,710
could just do that, if
you will, at the

382
00:25:50,710 --> 00:25:52,940
time I wrote my program.

383
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:55,240
But here I want it
to be determined,

384
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:57,280
chosen at run time.

385
00:25:57,280 --> 00:26:03,070
So first, I choose a volatility
randomly, from some

386
00:26:03,070 --> 00:26:06,950
distribution of possible
volatilities from 0 to, in

387
00:26:06,950 --> 00:26:12,930
this case, 0.2.

388
00:26:12,930 --> 00:26:17,140
Think of this as the percentage
move per day.

389
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:22,070
So 2/10 of a percent, would
be the move here.

390
00:26:22,070 --> 00:26:28,130
And then I'll create this
function, this distribution d

391
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:33,720
1, which will, whenever I call
it, give me a random, a

392
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:37,930
uniformly selected value
between minus and plus

393
00:26:37,930 --> 00:26:42,210
volatility.

394
00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:48,670
Then when I create the stock,
here, I can pass it

395
00:26:48,670 --> 00:26:54,040
in, pass in d 1.

396
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,310
OK, it's a new concept.

397
00:26:55,310 --> 00:26:58,240
I don't expect you'll all
immediately grab it, but you

398
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:05,000
will need to understand it
before the quiz comes along.

399
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:08,110
And then I could also do a
Gaussian one here, with the

400
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:11,230
mean of 0 and the standard
deviation of volatility

401
00:27:11,230 --> 00:27:13,530
divided by 2.

402
00:27:13,530 --> 00:27:15,260
Where do these parameters
come from?

403
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:17,530
I made them up out
of whole cloth.

404
00:27:17,530 --> 00:27:20,620
Later we'll talk about how 1
could think about them more

405
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:24,710
intelligently.

406
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:29,210
Now what do I do with that?

407
00:27:29,210 --> 00:27:31,040
All right, we'll see
that in a minute.

408
00:27:31,040 --> 00:27:38,120
But people understand what
the basic idea here is.

409
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:44,110
Now, I can set the
price of a stock.

410
00:27:44,110 --> 00:27:47,910
And when I do that, I'll
append it to history.

411
00:27:47,910 --> 00:27:50,380
I can, oh, these have got
some remnants which we

412
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:52,330
really don't need.

413
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:58,290
I'll get rid of this which is
just an uninteresting thing.

414
00:27:58,290 --> 00:28:05,020
And let's look at make move.

415
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:06,490
Because this is the
interesting thing.

416
00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:11,520
Make move is what we call to
change the price of a stock,

417
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:14,800
at the beginning or end
of a day if you will.

418
00:28:14,800 --> 00:28:18,730
So the first thing it does, is
it says, if self dot price is

419
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:23,360
0, I'm just going to return.

420
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:26,550
This is not the right thing
to do, by the way.

421
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:30,790
Again, there are some
bugs in here.

422
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:33,120
You won't find these bugs
in your handout, right?

423
00:28:33,120 --> 00:28:35,240
Code is different
in the handout.

424
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:39,400
But I wanted to show these to
you so we could think about.

425
00:28:39,400 --> 00:28:41,820
What I'm more interested in here
than in the result of the

426
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:46,220
simulation, is the process
of creating it.

427
00:28:46,220 --> 00:28:48,400
So why did I put this here?

428
00:28:48,400 --> 00:28:53,900
Why did I say if self dot
price equals 0 return?

429
00:28:53,900 --> 00:28:57,660
Because the first time I wrote
the program, I didn't have

430
00:28:57,660 --> 00:29:00,730
anything like that here,
and a stock could go

431
00:29:00,730 --> 00:29:03,040
to 0 and then recover.

432
00:29:03,040 --> 00:29:05,650
Or even go to negative values.

433
00:29:05,650 --> 00:29:09,110
Well we know stock prices
are never negative.

434
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:12,010
And in fact we know if the price
goes to 0, it's delisted

435
00:29:12,010 --> 00:29:14,460
from the exchange.

436
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:16,460
So I said, all right, we better
make a special case of

437
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:24,130
that. it turns out, that this
will be a bug, and I want you

438
00:29:24,130 --> 00:29:29,740
to think about why it's wrong
for me to put this check here.

439
00:29:29,740 --> 00:29:32,750
The check needs to be somewhere
in the program, but

440
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:36,270
this is not the right
place for it.

441
00:29:36,270 --> 00:29:40,640
So think about why I didn't
leave it here.

442
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:44,620
OK, then we'll get the old
price, which we're going to

443
00:29:44,620 --> 00:29:49,180
try and remember, and now comes
the interesting part.

444
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:51,010
We're going to try and
figure out how the

445
00:29:51,010 --> 00:29:54,840
price should change.

446
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:56,650
So I'm first going to
compute something

447
00:29:56,650 --> 00:29:59,650
called the base move.

448
00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:02,280
Think of this as kind of the
basis from which we'll be

449
00:30:02,280 --> 00:30:05,880
computing the actual move.

450
00:30:05,880 --> 00:30:12,030
I'll draw something from the
distribution, so this is

451
00:30:12,030 --> 00:30:15,720
interesting, I'm now calling
self dot distribution, and

452
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:20,270
remember this will be different
for each stock.

453
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:23,840
It will return me some random
value from either the Gaussian

454
00:30:23,840 --> 00:30:28,460
or the normal distribution.

455
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:30,840
With a different volatility for
the stocks because that

456
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:35,340
was also selected randomly,
plus some market bias.

457
00:30:35,340 --> 00:30:37,670
Saying, well, the market on
average will go up a little

458
00:30:37,670 --> 00:30:42,530
bit, or go down a little bit.

459
00:30:42,530 --> 00:30:46,500
And then I'll set the new price,
if you will, self dot

460
00:30:46,500 --> 00:30:52,240
price, to self dot price times
1 plus the base move.

461
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,410
So notice what this says.

462
00:30:53,410 --> 00:31:00,670
If the base move is 0, then
the price doesn't change.

463
00:31:00,670 --> 00:31:02,740
So that makes sense.

464
00:31:02,740 --> 00:31:04,780
Interesting question.

465
00:31:04,780 --> 00:31:12,800
Why do you think I said self
dot price times 1 plus the

466
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:16,280
base move, rather than just
adding the base move to the

467
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:18,480
stock, price of the stock?

468
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:22,090
Again, the first time I coded
this, I had an addition there

469
00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:24,710
instead of a multiplication.

470
00:31:24,710 --> 00:31:31,190
What would the ramifications
of an addition there be?

471
00:31:31,190 --> 00:31:35,360
That would say, how much the
stock changed is independent

472
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:39,430
of its current price.

473
00:31:39,430 --> 00:31:43,780
And when I ran that it, I got
weird results, because we know

474
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:49,750
that a Google priced at, say,
300, is much more likely to

475
00:31:49,750 --> 00:31:53,440
move by 10 points in
a day than a stock

476
00:31:53,440 --> 00:31:58,290
that's priced at $0.50.

477
00:31:58,290 --> 00:32:02,120
So in fact, it is the case, if
you look at data, and by the

478
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:04,360
way, that's the way I ended
up setting a lot of these

479
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:07,840
parameters and playing with
it, was comparing what my

480
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:11,190
simulation said to historical
stock data.

481
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:14,540
And indeed it is the case that
the price of the stock, the

482
00:32:14,540 --> 00:32:18,060
move, the amount of move, tends
to be proportional to

483
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:20,130
the price of the stock.

484
00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:22,910
Expensive stocks move more.

485
00:32:22,910 --> 00:32:25,430
Interestingly enough, the
percentage moves are not much

486
00:32:25,430 --> 00:32:29,630
different between cheap stocks
and expensive stocks.

487
00:32:29,630 --> 00:32:34,770
And that's why, I ended up using
a multiplicative factor,

488
00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:47,880
rather than an additive
factor.

489
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:50,060
This is again a general
lesson.

490
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:53,150
As you build these kinds of
simulations, or anything like

491
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:57,950
this, you need to think through
whether things should

492
00:32:57,950 --> 00:32:59,880
be multiplicative or additive.

493
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:03,160
Because you get very different
results, typically.

494
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:07,270
Multiplicative is what you want
to do if the amount of

495
00:33:07,270 --> 00:33:12,900
change is proportional to the
current size, whether it's

496
00:33:12,900 --> 00:33:16,970
price or anything else, and
additive if the change is

497
00:33:16,970 --> 00:33:21,840
independent of the current
value, typically, is I think

498
00:33:21,840 --> 00:33:27,140
the general way to
think about it.

499
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:31,350
Now, you'll see this other
kind of peculiar thing.

500
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:39,880
So I've now set the price, and
then I've got this test here.

501
00:33:39,880 --> 00:33:45,570
If mo, mo stands for momentum.

502
00:33:45,570 --> 00:33:53,390
I'm now exploring the question
of whether or not stock prices

503
00:33:53,390 --> 00:34:03,000
are indeed memoryless,
or the stock changes.

504
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:09,240
And the fancy word for
that is Poisson.

505
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:14,710
People often model things as
Poisson processes, which is to

506
00:34:14,710 --> 00:34:20,410
say, processes in which past
behavior has no impact on

507
00:34:20,410 --> 00:34:24,030
future behavior, it's
memoryless.

508
00:34:24,030 --> 00:34:29,200
And in fact, that's what the
Efficient Market Hypothesis

509
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:31,940
purports to say.

510
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:35,930
It says that, since all the
information is in the current

511
00:34:35,930 --> 00:34:38,790
price, you don't have to worry
about whether it went up or

512
00:34:38,790 --> 00:34:45,610
down yesterday, to decide what
it's going to do today.

513
00:34:45,610 --> 00:34:48,500
There are people who don't
believe that, and instead

514
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:52,470
argue that there is this
notion called momentum.

515
00:34:52,470 --> 00:34:54,690
These are called momentum
investors.

516
00:34:54,690 --> 00:34:58,180
And they say, what's most likely
to happen today, is

517
00:34:58,180 --> 00:35:00,110
what happened yesterday.

518
00:35:00,110 --> 00:35:01,490
Or more likely.

519
00:35:01,490 --> 00:35:03,810
If the stock went up yesterday,
it's more likely to

520
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:08,360
go up today, than if it didn't
go up yesterday.

521
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:12,180
So I wasn't sure which religion
I was willing to

522
00:35:12,180 --> 00:35:16,910
believe in, if either, so I
added a parameter called, if

523
00:35:16,910 --> 00:35:20,870
you believe in momentum,
then you should change

524
00:35:20,870 --> 00:35:23,970
the price by --

525
00:35:23,970 --> 00:35:27,310
And here I just did something
taking a Gaussian times the

526
00:35:27,310 --> 00:35:32,230
last change, and, in
fact, added it in.

527
00:35:32,230 --> 00:35:35,610
So if it went up yesterday, it
will more likely go up today,

528
00:35:35,610 --> 00:35:39,130
because I'm throwing in a
positive number, otherwise a

529
00:35:39,130 --> 00:35:41,430
negative number.

530
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:44,750
Notice that this is additive.

531
00:35:44,750 --> 00:35:48,910
Because it's dealing with
yesterday's price.

532
00:35:48,910 --> 00:35:51,140
Change, with the change.

533
00:35:51,140 --> 00:35:56,740
OK, so that's why we're
dealing with that.

534
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:59,950
Now, here's where I should've
put in this test

535
00:35:59,950 --> 00:36:03,660
that I had up here.

536
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:05,850
Get it out from there.

537
00:36:05,850 --> 00:36:08,860
Because what I want to do is,
say if self dot price is less

538
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:14,390
than 0.01, I'm going to set it
to 0, just keep it there.

539
00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:19,770
That doesn't solve the problem
we had before though, right?

540
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:26,020
Then I'm going to append it, and
keep the last change for

541
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:28,360
future use.

542
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:32,220
OK, people understand what's
going on here?

543
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:35,140
And then show history is just
going to produce a plot.

544
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:37,990
We've seen that a million
times before.

545
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:42,840
Any questions about this?

546
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:45,480
Well, I have a question?

547
00:36:45,480 --> 00:36:46,640
Does it make any sense?

548
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,000
Is it going to work at all?

549
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,220
So now let's test it.

550
00:36:51,220 --> 00:36:57,790
So, I now have this
unit test program

551
00:36:57,790 --> 00:37:01,360
called unit test stock.

552
00:37:01,360 --> 00:37:04,450
I originally did not make it a
function, I had it in-line,

553
00:37:04,450 --> 00:37:07,600
and I realized that was really
stupid, because I wanted to do

554
00:37:07,600 --> 00:37:10,720
it a lot of times.

555
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:15,710
So it's got an internal
procedure, internal function,

556
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:20,260
local to the unit test, that
runs the simulation.

557
00:37:20,260 --> 00:37:25,880
And it takes the set of stocks
to simulate, a fig, figure

558
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:29,290
number, this is going to print
a bunch of graphs, and I want

559
00:37:29,290 --> 00:37:32,320
to say what graph it is,
and whether or not I

560
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:35,940
believe in big mo.

561
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:41,470
It sets the mean to 0, and then
for s in the stocks, it

562
00:37:41,470 --> 00:37:46,340
moves it, giving it the bias
and the momentum, then it

563
00:37:46,340 --> 00:37:49,190
shows the history.

564
00:37:49,190 --> 00:37:53,440
And then computes the mean of,
getting me the mean of all the

565
00:37:53,440 --> 00:37:54,160
stocks in it.

566
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:57,570
We've seen this sort of thing
many times before.

567
00:37:57,570 --> 00:37:59,810
I've then got some constants.

568
00:37:59,810 --> 00:38:02,190
By the way, I want to emphasize
that I've named

569
00:38:02,190 --> 00:38:04,860
these constants to make
it easier to change.

570
00:38:04,860 --> 00:38:10,710
Starting with 20 stocks,
100 days.

571
00:38:10,710 --> 00:38:15,940
And then what I do is, I stock
sub 1, stocks 1 will be the

572
00:38:15,940 --> 00:38:19,430
empty list, stocks 2 is the
empty list. Why do you think

573
00:38:19,430 --> 00:38:27,010
I'm starting with bias of 0?

574
00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:32,490
Because, what do you think the
mean should be, if I simulate

575
00:38:32,490 --> 00:38:35,990
various things that
the bias of 0?

576
00:38:35,990 --> 00:38:39,585
I start $100 as the average
price of the stock, what

577
00:38:39,585 --> 00:38:42,240
should the average price
of the stock be?

578
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:45,350
If my code is correct, what
should the average price be,

579
00:38:45,350 --> 00:38:50,270
after say, 100 days,
if there's no bias.

580
00:38:50,270 --> 00:38:51,480
Pardon?

581
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,810
100, exactly.

582
00:38:53,810 --> 00:38:56,580
Since there's no upward
or downward bias.

583
00:38:56,580 --> 00:39:00,130
They may fluctuate wildly, but
if I look at enough stocks,

584
00:39:00,130 --> 00:39:03,600
the average should be
right around 100.

585
00:39:03,600 --> 00:39:05,690
I don't know what the average
would be if I chose a

586
00:39:05,690 --> 00:39:07,080
different bias.

587
00:39:07,080 --> 00:39:11,940
It's a little bit complicated,
so I chose the simplest bias.

588
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:14,360
Important lesson, so that
there would be some

589
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:18,250
predictability in the results,
and I would have some, if you

590
00:39:18,250 --> 00:39:22,300
will, smoke test for knowing
whether or not I was getting,

591
00:39:22,300 --> 00:39:27,530
my code seemed to be working.

592
00:39:27,530 --> 00:39:31,800
All right, and initially, well,
maybe initially, just to

593
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:39,360
be simple I'm going to start
momentum equal to false.

594
00:39:39,360 --> 00:39:41,990
Because, again, it seems simpler
have a model where

595
00:39:41,990 --> 00:39:43,790
there's no momentum.

596
00:39:43,790 --> 00:39:46,630
I'm looking for the simplest
model possible for the first

597
00:39:46,630 --> 00:39:49,230
time I run it.

598
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:51,780
And then we looked at this
little loop before, for i in

599
00:39:51,780 --> 00:39:55,470
range number of stocks, I'm
going to create two different

600
00:39:55,470 --> 00:40:00,330
lists of stocks, one where the
moves, or distributions, are

601
00:40:00,330 --> 00:40:04,530
chosen from a uniform, and the
other where they're Gaussian.

602
00:40:04,530 --> 00:40:07,780
Because I'm sort of curious as
to, again, which is the right

603
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:14,090
way to think about
this, all right?

604
00:40:14,090 --> 00:40:18,940
And then, I'm going
to just call it.

605
00:40:18,940 --> 00:40:22,030
We'll see what we get.

606
00:40:22,030 --> 00:40:22,780
So let's do it.

607
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:24,730
Let's hope that all the
changes I mad have not

608
00:40:24,730 --> 00:40:29,920
introduced a syntax error.

609
00:40:29,920 --> 00:40:31,670
All right, well at least
it did something.

610
00:40:31,670 --> 00:40:39,750
Let's see what it did.

611
00:40:39,750 --> 00:40:43,740
So the test on the left, you'll
remember, was the one

612
00:40:43,740 --> 00:40:47,930
with test one, I believe, was
the uniform distribution, and

613
00:40:47,930 --> 00:40:51,180
test two is the Gaussian.

614
00:40:51,180 --> 00:40:55,290
So, but let's, what should
we do first?

615
00:40:55,290 --> 00:41:00,240
Well, let's do the smoke test
number one: is the mean more

616
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,790
or less what we expected?

617
00:41:02,790 --> 00:41:05,740
Well, it looks like it's dead on
100, which was our initial

618
00:41:05,740 --> 00:41:09,120
price in test two.

619
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:12,440
And in test one it's a
little bit above 100.

620
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:16,960
But, we didn't do that many
stocks, or that many days, so

621
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:24,230
it's quite plausible
that it's correct.

622
00:41:24,230 --> 00:41:28,000
But, just to be sure, not to be
sure, but just to increase

623
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:46,740
my confidence, I'm going
to just run it again.

624
00:41:46,740 --> 00:41:51,110
Well, here I'm a little bit
below 100 and in two, and test

625
00:41:51,110 --> 00:41:53,510
one a little bit below
100 as well.

626
00:41:53,510 --> 00:41:56,820
You remember last time was
a little bit above 100.

627
00:41:56,820 --> 00:41:59,900
I feel pretty good about this,
and in fact I ran it a lot of

628
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:01,540
times in my office.

629
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:05,100
And it just bounces around,
hovering around 100.

630
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:06,760
Course, this is the wrong
way to do it.

631
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:09,690
I should really just put it in
a nice test harness, where I

632
00:42:09,690 --> 00:42:14,370
run 100, 200, 1,000 trials, but
I didn't want to bore you

633
00:42:14,370 --> 00:42:15,930
with that here.

634
00:42:15,930 --> 00:42:20,950
So we'll see that, OK, we passed
the first smoke test.

635
00:42:20,950 --> 00:42:25,130
We seem to be where
we expect to be.

636
00:42:25,130 --> 00:42:30,080
Well, let's try smoke
test two.

637
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:32,420
What else might we want to see,
to see if we got things

638
00:42:32,420 --> 00:42:34,580
working properly?

639
00:42:34,580 --> 00:42:39,590
Well, I kind of ignored the
notion of bias by making it 0,

640
00:42:39,590 --> 00:42:49,730
so let's give it a
big bias here.

641
00:42:49,730 --> 00:43:09,830
Assuming it will
let me edit it.

642
00:43:09,830 --> 00:43:11,550
We just gotta start it
up again, it's the

643
00:43:11,550 --> 00:43:34,890
safest thing to do.

644
00:43:34,890 --> 00:43:38,120
You wouldn't think I would
have, I don't have -- all

645
00:43:38,120 --> 00:43:42,800
right, be that way about it.

646
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:46,440
Fortunately, we've been
through this before.

647
00:43:46,440 --> 00:43:49,750
We know if we relaunch
the Finder.

648
00:43:49,750 --> 00:43:58,300
Who says Mac OS is flawless?

649
00:43:58,300 --> 00:44:07,290
All right, we were down here,
and I was saying, let's try a

650
00:44:07,290 --> 00:44:10,490
larger, introduce a bias.

651
00:44:10,490 --> 00:44:12,580
Again, we're trying to see
if it does what we

652
00:44:12,580 --> 00:44:13,970
think it might do.

653
00:44:13,970 --> 00:44:17,020
So what do you think it
should do with a bias?

654
00:44:17,020 --> 00:44:21,710
Where should the mean be now?

655
00:44:21,710 --> 00:44:24,730
Still around 100?

656
00:44:24,730 --> 00:44:26,300
Or higher, right?

657
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:29,660
Because we've now put in
a bias suggesting that

658
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:31,460
it should go up.

659
00:44:31,460 --> 00:44:33,090
Oops.

660
00:44:33,090 --> 00:44:37,720
It wouldn't have hurt it.

661
00:44:37,720 --> 00:44:39,550
All right.

662
00:44:39,550 --> 00:44:49,730
So let's run it.

663
00:44:49,730 --> 00:44:54,220
Sure enough, for one, we see,
test two, it's a little bit

664
00:44:54,220 --> 00:45:02,760
over 100, and for test one
it's way over 100.

665
00:45:02,760 --> 00:45:11,130
Well, let's make sure
it's not a fluke.

666
00:45:11,130 --> 00:45:21,730
Try it again.

667
00:45:21,730 --> 00:45:26,940
So, sure enough, changing the
bias changed the price, and

668
00:45:26,940 --> 00:45:31,170
even changed it in the
right direction.

669
00:45:31,170 --> 00:45:33,990
So we can feel pretty
comfortable that it's doing

670
00:45:33,990 --> 00:45:35,380
something good with that.

671
00:45:35,380 --> 00:45:37,350
We could also feel pretty
comfortable that that's

672
00:45:37,350 --> 00:45:40,140
probably way too high
a bias, right?

673
00:45:40,140 --> 00:45:45,740
We would not expect that the
mean should be over 160, or in

674
00:45:45,740 --> 00:45:49,850
one case, 150, after only
100 days trading, right?

675
00:45:49,850 --> 00:45:53,580
Things don't typically go
up 50% in 100 days.

676
00:45:53,580 --> 00:46:00,000
They go down 50%, but --

677
00:46:00,000 --> 00:46:03,590
All right, so that's good.

678
00:46:03,590 --> 00:46:06,960
Oh, let's look at something
else now.

679
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:10,360
Let's go back to where,
a simpler bias here.

680
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:13,440
We'll run it again.

681
00:46:13,440 --> 00:46:16,910
And think about, what's the
difference between the

682
00:46:16,910 --> 00:46:26,110
Gaussian and the normal?

683
00:46:26,110 --> 00:46:35,490
Can we deduce anything
about those?

684
00:46:35,490 --> 00:46:37,870
Not, well, let me ask you.

685
00:46:37,870 --> 00:46:45,260
What do you think, yes or no?

686
00:46:45,260 --> 00:46:47,450
Anybody see anything
interesting here?

687
00:46:47,450 --> 00:46:47,730
Yeah?

688
00:46:47,730 --> 00:46:52,625
STUDENT: The variance of the
Gaussian seems to be less than

689
00:46:52,625 --> 00:46:54,860
the variance of the uniform.

690
00:46:54,860 --> 00:46:55,960
PROFESSOR: The variance
of the Gaussian --

691
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:59,620
STUDENT: -- is less.

692
00:46:59,620 --> 00:47:02,810
PROFESSOR: So all right, that
appears to be the case here.

693
00:47:02,810 --> 00:47:04,860
But let's run it again,
as we've done with

694
00:47:04,860 --> 00:47:06,490
all the other tests.

695
00:47:06,490 --> 00:47:09,680
So we have a hypothesis.

696
00:47:09,680 --> 00:47:13,440
Let's not fall victim to the
Oklahoma sharpshooter.

697
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:19,860
We'll test our hypothesis, or at
least examine it again, see

698
00:47:19,860 --> 00:47:27,230
if it's, in some sense,
repeatable.

699
00:47:27,230 --> 00:47:32,860
Well, now what do we see?

700
00:47:32,860 --> 00:47:35,880
Doesn't seem to be true
this time, right?

701
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:37,960
Not obviously.

702
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:42,240
So, we're not sure about this.

703
00:47:42,240 --> 00:47:43,960
So this is something
that we would need

704
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:49,420
to investigate further.

705
00:47:49,420 --> 00:47:52,320
And we would need, to have to
look at it, and it's going to

706
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:57,470
be very tricky, by the way, as
to what the right answer is.

707
00:47:57,470 --> 00:48:04,200
But if you think about it, it
would not be surprising if the

708
00:48:04,200 --> 00:48:09,350
Gaussians, at least, gave us
some surprising, more extreme,

709
00:48:09,350 --> 00:48:12,030
results, than the uniform.

710
00:48:12,030 --> 00:48:16,950
Because the uniform, as we've
set it up here, is bounded.

711
00:48:16,950 --> 00:48:22,280
The minimum and the maximum
is bounded.

712
00:48:22,280 --> 00:48:26,950
With the Gaussian,
there's a tail.

713
00:48:26,950 --> 00:48:29,830
And you might every once in a
while get this, at least as

714
00:48:29,830 --> 00:48:31,450
we've done it in this
case, this large

715
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:34,570
move out at the end.

716
00:48:34,570 --> 00:48:36,790
You might not.

717
00:48:36,790 --> 00:48:40,460
There's nothing profound about
this, other than the

718
00:48:40,460 --> 00:48:44,350
understanding that the details
of how you set these things up

719
00:48:44,350 --> 00:48:47,210
can matter a lot.

720
00:48:47,210 --> 00:48:54,770
Well, the final thing I want
to look at is momentum.

721
00:48:54,770 --> 00:49:07,040
So let's go back, and let's
set mo to true here.

722
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:10,930
Well, doesn't want us to
set mo to true here.

723
00:49:10,930 --> 00:49:16,720
Ah, there it does.

724
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:19,460
So, and now let's run it
and see what happens.

725
00:49:19,460 --> 00:49:25,850
What do you think
should happen?

726
00:49:25,850 --> 00:49:26,410
Anybody?

727
00:49:26,410 --> 00:49:31,726
STUDENT: [INAUDIBLE]

728
00:49:31,726 --> 00:49:36,620
PROFESSOR: I think
you're right.

729
00:49:36,620 --> 00:49:41,420
These ones should curl, see
if I can -- oh, not bad.

730
00:49:41,420 --> 00:49:48,610
Let's run it.

731
00:49:48,610 --> 00:49:53,460
Well, it's a little hard
to see, but things

732
00:49:53,460 --> 00:49:56,500
tend to take off.

733
00:49:56,500 --> 00:49:59,895
Because once things started
moving, it tends to move in

734
00:49:59,895 --> 00:50:05,640
that direction.

735
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:10,710
All right.

736
00:50:10,710 --> 00:50:12,750
How do we go about choosing
these parameters?

737
00:50:12,750 --> 00:50:14,880
How do we go about deciding
what to do?

738
00:50:14,880 --> 00:50:18,510
Well, we play with it, the way
I've been playing with it, and

739
00:50:18,510 --> 00:50:22,490
compare the results to some
set of real data.

740
00:50:22,490 --> 00:50:26,820
And then we try and get our
simulation to match the past,

741
00:50:26,820 --> 00:50:31,600
and hope that that will help
it predict the future.

742
00:50:31,600 --> 00:50:33,480
We're not enough time to
go through all the,

743
00:50:33,480 --> 00:50:35,460
to do that a lot.

744
00:50:35,460 --> 00:50:38,850
I will be posting code that
you can play with, and I

745
00:50:38,850 --> 00:50:42,850
suggest you go through exactly
this kind of exercise.

746
00:50:42,850 --> 00:50:45,590
Because this is really the way
that people do develop

747
00:50:45,590 --> 00:50:46,930
simulations.

748
00:50:46,930 --> 00:50:48,810
They don't, out of whole
cloth, get it

749
00:50:48,810 --> 00:50:50,700
right the first time.

750
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:54,580
They build them, they do what if
games, they play with them,

751
00:50:54,580 --> 00:50:57,870
and then they try and adjust
them to get them right.

752
00:50:57,870 --> 00:51:00,980
The nice thing here is, you can
decide whether you believe

753
00:51:00,980 --> 00:51:04,370
momentum and see what it would
mean, or not mean, etc.

754
00:51:04,370 --> 00:51:06,940
All right, one more lecture.

755
00:51:06,940 --> 00:51:09,140
See you guys next week.

756
00:51:09,140 --> 00:51:09,537
